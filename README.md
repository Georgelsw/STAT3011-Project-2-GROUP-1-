## Statistic project 2-Pizza Analysis 
This project is based on Chapter 27: Pizza Restaurant Data Analysis of Data Science, Analytics, and AI for Business and the Real World. By using the data csv provided in the reference book, we performed different data manipulation and analysis to solve different problems.  

For information of the data csv, visit (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajeevratan84/data-analyst-bootcamp/master/8358_1.csv).

### 0. Data Processing  
Person-in-charge: All  
Related Documents: 2016 US GDP.xlsx, Detect Outlier.ipynb, Imputation.ipynb, newpizzadata.csv, pizza&GDP.csv  
- Searched 2016 US GDP for Accommodation and Food Services as extra data  
- Missing dataï¼ˆ use imputation to replace the Nah data and zero data)
- Outlier (detect and delete outlier for smooth data visualisation,regreesion and data.map)  


### 1. Data visualization  
Problem: State and location of the pizza restaurant?  
Person-in-charge: LI Shengwei, WONG Tuen Hung  
Related Documents:
- problems solution,improved code and extra graphs
- pizza map (average price, restaurant location, restaurant counts)
- word cloud  (the most popular pizza in menus, the most restaurant brand names and the most average price for pizza by detect the texts in csv.file.) 

### 2. Regression  
Problem: What factors are affecting the pizza business?  
Person-in-charge: LUI Chak Sum, FAN Jingyi  
Related Documents: Regression.R, scatterplot.png, residual_plot.png, QQplot.png  
- Build model see what factors are significant for GDP (profit of selling pizza)  

### 3. C.I. for price of pizza  
Problem: Range of the price that helps to maximize our profit?  
Person-in-charge: CHAU Ka Yan, CHEN Lu  
Related Documents:  
- calculate the C.I. of average/max. price of every types of pizza?  

### 4. Decision Tree  
Problem: Find out the decision direction for defining the pizza price as expensive or not. 
Person-in-charge: LI Shengwei, WONG Tuen Hung  
Related Documents:  
- classify the type of pizza as normal or expensive by factors such as maximum price, minimum price or GDP. 
- train parts of data set then test remaining data to check the decision tree model accuracy.
